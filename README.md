In machine learning, understanding measures of central tendency and measures of spread is crucial for analyzing data. 
These measures help in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Measures of Central Tendency includes:
Mean (Average): It is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers.
Median: It is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered. It's less affected by outliers.
Mode: It is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. A dataset can have one or multiple modes.
Measures of Spread (Dispersion)includes:
Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
Variance: It measures the average squared deviation of each value from the mean. A high variance indicates that the data points are spread out.
Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of each data point from the mean.
Quartiles and Interquartile Range (IQR): Quartiles divide a dataset into four equal parts, and the IQR is the difference between the third (75th percentile) and first quartiles (25th percentile). It's a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of values.
Skewness: Measures the asymmetry of the distribution. Positive skew means the tail is on the right side, negative skew the tail is on the left side.
